ColorChord is an open source project by cnlohr that allows users to control WS2811 individually addressable LEDs using the ESP8266 microcontroller. It operates at a sample rate of 8,000 to 16,000 samples per second and uses the I2S interface to send data to WS2812 LEDs. To build and use ColorChord, users must first set up the development tools for the ESP8266 and clone the Git repository, which includes the source code and dependencies. The repository includes instructions for building and flashing the firmware to the device, as well as options for debugging and modifying the code.
