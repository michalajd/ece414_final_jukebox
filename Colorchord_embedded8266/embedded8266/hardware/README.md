These were done in Kicad.  The libraries used are in the -cache files.  Please use the -cache's otherwise you can run into a lot of problems.

I do not have a colorchord-specific design for the ESP-12E.  I have included the generics file.

The esp_onelayer3 file was what was used in the Saxophone video.  A electret microphone was attached between GND and the T0 pin of the ESP.  Be sure to size the R1 aproprately for your mic.
